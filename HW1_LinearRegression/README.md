### Here’s a step-by-step Python code to solve a simple linear regression problem using the numpy library for computation.
We will walk through the following steps:
1. Generate some example data (inputs and outputs).
2. Calculate the coefficients (slope and intercept) for the line of best fit.
3. Plot the results.

### Explanation of each step:
1. Data Generation: We generate random X values between 0 and 2, and then compute the corresponding y values using a linear relation with some added noise.
2. Adding the bias term: We add a column of ones to X to account for the intercept (bias) term in the regression equation.
3. Normal Equation: The normal equation is used to compute the optimal values of the slope and intercept without the need for iterative optimization.
4. Predictions: After computing the parameters, we can predict y values for new X inputs.
5. Plotting: We plot the original data points and the line of best fit.

Here’s how to create a Streamlit application for the linear regression problem outlined above. You'll save the code in a file named part2.py.

### Step-by-Step Streamlit Application
1. Set Up Streamlit: Ensure you have Streamlit installed. If you haven't installed it yet, run:
` pip install streamlit `
2. Create the part2.py File: Open your favorite code editor and create a new file named part2.py.
3. Add the Following Code to part2.py:

### Running the Streamlit App
1. Navigate to the Directory: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved part2.py.
2. Run the Streamlit App: Execute the following command:
` streamlit run part2.py`
3. View in Browser: After running the command, your default web browser should open automatically to http://localhost:8501, where you can see your linear regression application in action.

### Explanation of the Streamlit App
- Title and Description: The app has a title and a brief description at the top.
- Linear Regression Function: The function linear_regression() handles data generation, computation of the model parameters, and plotting.
- Results Display: The intercept and slope are displayed in the app, along with a plot showing the data points and the regression line.
You can modify the app further to allow user input for different datasets or parameters as needed. Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!

## part3
`write a python file named part3.py  to solve linear regression problem and use streamlit , y = a*x+50+c*np.random, a is -10 to 10, c is 0 to 100, n is number of point 10 to 500, then show regression line`
